# Football Prediction App
##Project Description
This project is a full-stack web application built using Node.js, Express.js, Axios, and EJS. It integrates with the Football Prediction API hosted on RapidAPI to retrieve real-time football match predictions and display them in a clean, user-friendly dashboard.

The application demonstrates how to connect to an external REST API, securely handle API keys using environment variables, process JSON responses, and dynamically render data on the frontend using server-side templating.

Users can view upcoming football match predictions including home team, away team, predicted outcome, and match start date/time.
